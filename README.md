# WebNotes

WebNotes is a group project that has been started for our CS 386 class and will continue development till the end of Fall 2024. The existing codebase, with limited functionality, remains available under an MIT license. Please proceed at your own risk. 

Web Notes is a simple Chrome extension note-taking software that will allow users to take notes, share them with students, and save them efficiently.

## Status

Web Notes is currently in the early stages of development. Please contact the developers for any information.

## Development setup

WebNotes uses a Chrome extension for client-side operations. As of now this is an unpacked extension and must be loaded in developer mode on Google Chrome. Future releases will provide the packed version available on the Chrome Store.
Our server runs on Python using Flask and Flask-Cors, both of which are required to be installed in order for the server to function.
