            <p id="para">WebNotes enhances students' study experience by simplifying note taking and organization. Targeted at students who use canvas, it allows them to capture and manage information efficiently, and boosts their academic performance. WebNotes includes many features designed to enhance the digital note-taking experience for students. Current features include making new notes either through the extension popup or on the canvas page, which will automatically be saved to the server. Users can delete single notes or use the clear all notes button to remove all notes saved on the page giving them a more organized workspace. WebNotes has a search function allowing users to search their notes with ease, giving them quick and easy access. An optional dark mode, which can be easily toggled on or off, gives users a customisable experience suited for different lighting conditions or preference. An option to export notes saves all the notes to a downloaded text file. This gives users the chance to review their notes while offline or use them elsewhere for other purposes. Users can also log into an account on their canvas page and use this to set their notes to private. By default notes are set to public but can be toggled to private when logged in. This gives security and independence to the notes users wish to create.</p>
