# Software Inception Report
## Group 08 - WebNotes

### Summary:
Our mission at WebNotes is enabling students and educators to take better notes on their documents. Bookmark tabs can become cluttered and messy, and notes on paper can get damaged or lost. By taking digital notes with WebNotes, the user is able to create, share, and view sticky notes on any canvas webpage that are always backed up. Our convenient to install Chrome extension allows users to share notes with any student in their classes. Students can create discussions while professors answer questions and give instruction.

### Value Proposition:
Our software aims to provide students with a streamlined tool that allows them to easily save and organize online information, which helps them focus on their research and studies rather than spending time sifting through disorganized bookmarks and notes.
